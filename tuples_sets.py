# A tuple is a collection that is ordered and unchangeable. It allows for duplicates.

#Create a tuple
fruits = ('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes')
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes'))

#Single value needs a trailing comma
fruits2 = ('Apples', )

#Get a value
# print(fruits[1])

#Can't change a value
# fruits[0] = "Pies"

#Delete a tuple
del fruits2

#Get the length
# print(len(fruits))

# A set is a collection that is unordered and unindexed. It does not allow duplicates.
